**** 2. Subject of the License Contract ****

   1. The subject of this license contract is the concession of rights to use
      this software according to these licensing terms and according to the
      respective license type, which has been purchased by the licensee.
   2. The license type will be determined by the scope of the provided software
      selected by the licensee. The features of the software, as well as its
      scope and license price, result from the product description provided
      online, from the information gathered during the ordering process
      (product information) and from any documentation.
   3. Any further details or specifications will only become an integral part
      of the contract when agreed upon in writing by the contractual partners.
   4. Any other presentations of the software on the internet are for
      informational purposes only. They do not constitute a binding offer but
      are an opportunity to submit a binding offer of contract by placing an
      order.
   5. You may choose from the following license types:
         1. TexturePacker Evaluation ("Trial") License:
            An evaluation license (trial license) is a license (right of use)
            to the software, which authorizes the licensee to use all functions
            of the corresponding software product. A trial license, however,
            exclusively authorizes use of the software for testing and
            evaluating the software within the agreed period of time. The
            licensee is prohibited from using the trial license for publishing
            data generated within the TexturePacker evaluation license in his
            own products or in the software components of third parties or to
            use it for his own business purposes. In this case the purchase of
            a single user license, a volume license or a lifetime license is
            required.
         2. TexturePacker Single User License
            A single user license authorizes the named user to use the software
            with the provided license key on two clients (hardware, computer)
            maximum. The account name on both clients must be identical. The
            (shared) use of a TexturePacker single user license by more than
            one named user is expressly prohibited. The license key for a
            specific TexturePacker single user license may not be actively
            installed on more than two clients at the same time.
         3. TexturePacker Volume License
            A TexturePacker volume license authorizes the licensee to use the
            license key for as many additional software copies as permitted by
            the specified number of clients in the corresponding order
            confirmation or license certificate. The number of clients on which
            the software has been installed and for which the license key has
            been activated must not exceed the number of licenses. The clients
            may only be used by the corresponding number of users, i.e. a
            server installation is prohibited.
         4. TexturePacker Blogger / Framework Developer License
            The scope of a TexturePacker blogger/framework license corresponds
            to the scope of the TexturePacker single user license. This license
            may only be granted after prior verification and approval by
            CodeAndWeb and will be granted to blog writers or framework
            developers. The acquisition of this license is subject to a
            separate request to CodeAndWeb. There is no legal claim to a
            TexturePacker blogger/framework license.
         5. TexturePacker Server/Floating-License
            grants the Licensee the use of TexturePacker as a time limited
            network installation. Legally the licensee rents TexturePacker for
            a limited period of time. The licensee is authorized to run as many
            clients of TexturePacker simultaneously as permitted by the
            specified number of clients in the corresponding order confirmation
            or license certificate (hereinafter referred to as “seats”). The
            license will automatically expire after one year, if not subject to
            prior or automatic renewal ordered via the 2checkout processor. The
            license period begins with the day, which follows the day of its
            first activation and expires on the corresponding date the year
            hereafter.
         6. TexturePacker Essential Mode (free for non commercial projects)
            If none of the above-mentioned licenses is available, TexturePacker
            may start with reduced functionality ("Essential Mode").
            The Essential Mode must not be used to create sprite sheets or
            images for commercial projects.
         7. TexturePacker Beta License
            CodeAndWeb makes the software accessible to licensee prior to the
            general commercial release of such software. The licensee is not
            required to use the beta version of the software. Nevertheless, if
            CodeAndWeb offers it, licensee may elect to use it under the
            following mentioned terms. The right to use the beta TexturePacker
            software may be limited in time, and may be subject to additional
            following subscription terms. CodeAndWeb may request or require
            that the licensee provide suggestions, feedback, or data regarding
            the use of the beta software. In addition to the waivers and
            limitations of liability for all software under TexturePacker beta
            license, licensee specifically acknowledge that beta software is
            not final and may create incompatibilities or damage to your
            computer, data, and/or software. If licensee decides to install
            and/or use beta TexturePacker software, it is entirely at own risk.
            CodeAndWeb shall terminate the licenses if licensee sell or attempt
            to sell the beta version of TexturePacker. CodeAndWeb may deny or
            revoke a beta license for any reason. In connection with
            TexturePacker beta license, licensee may not use the software in
            any way that would compete with CodeAndWeb.
   6. The source code of the software is not subject of the contract and
      specifically will not be provided.
   7. The license that the software is based on, as well as the associated
      license key, may neither be sold nor transferred if and insofar as the
      software is labelled "not for sale" or "not for resale".
   8. CodeAndWeb points out, that especially for reasons of system security,
      stability and compatibility, updates will be performed and new versions
      will be created or the software will be improved otherwise, where
      necessary. Therefore, the conditions for using the software may change
      over time. The provided updates and their use are subject to the terms of
      this agreement.
   9. The use and provision of free software updates is limited in time
      (paragraph 8).
  10. CodeAndWeb reserves the right to change the licensing terms. CodeAndWeb
      will inform the licensee about any changes.

**** 3. Scope of Rights of Use Granted (License) ****

   1. CodeAndWeb grants the licensee, if it is not a time limited license, an
      unlimited, revocable, non-exclusive (simple), non-transferable, non-
      sublicensable right to use this software subject to the payment of any
      applicable license fees (paragraph 6). The aforementioned rights do not
      apply for the Server/Floating-License. The Server/Floating-License is a
      time limited license, which is legally qualified as a software rental. In
      case of a Server/Floating-License CodeAndWeb grants the licensee a
      limited, timed for one year after activation if not subject to prior or
      automatic renewal ordered via the 2checkout processor, revocable, non-
      exclusive (simple), non-transferable, non-sublicensable right to use
      TexturePacker as a network installation for the specific amount of
      simultaneously running seats subject to the payment of any applicable
      license fees (paragraph 6). Any type of license is limited to internal
      use for the licensee only. Any business model offering functionalities of
      TexturePacker to third parties is prohibited. TexturePacker may not be
      used as service to third parties. This applies whether such service is
      free of charge or not.
   2. This includes the right
         1. to use the software, the license key and the documentation enclosed
            in the form in which it was provided to the licensee by CodeAndWeb;
         2. to use the software and the associated license key in strict
            accordance with the terms of this agreement and under the specific
            conditions and limitations, which are given by the specific license
            type
         3. to copy this software under the condition that all property rights,
            trademark symbols, copyright signs and notes and other proprietary
            notices will be reproduced on such a copy and that the license key
            for this software will not be passed to third parties
   3. The software and the associated documentation, all copies, modifications,
      translations, components, functions and connected parts thereof will
      always remain property of CodeAndWeb.
   4. The agreement on the scope of the license granted extends to all updates,
      upgrades, releases, revisions or improvements of the software, which are
      provided to the licensee by CodeAndWeb. The use and provision of free
      updates for this software after its installation and activation with the
      license key is limited in time (paragraph 8).

**** 4. License Restrictions ****

   1. The licensee is obligated to neither directly nor on behalf of a parent
      or affiliated company, a related company, a representative or a third
      party, perform the following actions with regard to the licensed software
      or its documentation, unless CodeAndWeb has previously given its written
      consent:
   2.    1. Use of the software, of the associated license key or of the
            documentation in violation of the terms of this agreement,
            particularly of the scope of the license type granted;
         2. Authorization of the multiple use of software copies and of the
            license key, insofar as this is not permitted by a corresponding
            license type;
         3. Sale, rent, licensing, sublicensing or further disposal of a part
            of the software or the documentation;
         4. Providing the license keys to persons, who are not licensees,
            without prior written consent from CodeAndWeb. This applies to the
            same extent to lending, disclosing, publishing, providing or
            permitting the use of the license key;
         5. Removal or modification of proprietary notices, labels or marks on
            a copy of the software or documentation;

            translation, attempting to find the source code or creation of
            adaptations (derivative works) of the software.
         7. The Server/Floating License is the only type of license that grants
            the licensee rights to use TexturePacker in a network environment.
            All other types of licenses grant the licensee only single client
            rights which are bound to desktop computers. The user of
            TexturePacker has to be user of the same desktop computer the
            TexturePacker installation is running on. Any use of TexturePacker
            as a SaaS, Server-Client-Systems, Remote-Controlled Systems via
            e.g. Team-Viewer, as a job donkey machine, inframe-like techniques
            or api-hooking is prohibited. It is prohibited to share the
            functionalities of TexturePacker via any sort of network
            techniques.
   3. Mandatory legal provisions such as those in § 69 e Copyright Act (UrhG)
      will remain unaffected.

**** 5. End-User Obligations ****

   1. The end-user has gathered information about the main features of the
      software and the respective license type. CodeAndWeb has no influence
      over whether and to what extent the software will meet the wishes and
      needs of the end-user.
   2. The end-user is obligated to register with correct and complete
      information in order to use this software where required.
   3. The end-user takes appropriate measures to protect the license key
      against unauthorized access by third parties.
   4. The end-user is responsible for preserving the confidentiality of the
      license key (access data) assigned. He is liable for all culpable
      infringements, which cause damage regarding his access, his account or
      his use of this software
   5. The end-user is obligated to immediately inform CodeAndWeb about any
      suspicion of unauthorized use of the access data, i.e. an unauthorized
      access to the license key.

**** 6. License Fee ****

   1. The fee for using the software is determined by the license type
      selected.
   2. The fee must be paid in advance.
   3. CodeAndWeb reserves the right to carry out the invoicing by itself or by
      an invoicing company commissioned by CodeAndWeb. When using an invoicing
      system, this system will bill on behalf and for the account of CodeAndWeb
      according to the utilization of the fee-based license type.
   4. In this respect, CodeAndWeb has no direct influence over the applicable
      payment and agreement terms.

**** 7. Contract Duration and Termination of the Right of Use ****

   1. The license agreement with the licensee is concluded for an indefinite
      period of time.
   2. The rights of the end-user and the licensee according to paragraph 3
      shall not pass to the client before complete settlement of all existing
      accounts receivable of a client arising from the current business
      relationship with CodeAndWeb or its invoicing company. Prior to this, the
      client has only a temporary, contractual and revocable right of use.
   3. CodeAndWeb reserves the right to block the license key and thus the
      software use in the form of the respective license type when these
      obligations are violated.
   4. CodeAndWeb may revoke the granted rights of use for good cause. In this
      case the rights granted to the client shall expire automatically with
      immediate effect, if and as soon as the client significantly violates the
      restrictions on use as specified in this agreement (paragraph 4).
   5. If and insofar as the right of use will not arise or will end, the client
      is obligated to immediately delete all copies of the program available to
      him and to delete the license key. The right of CodeAndWeb to block the
      license key remains unaffected.

**** 8. Updates ****

   1. The software may need updates in order to work effectively. Updates may
      include new features, bug-fixes or the removal of features of the
      software and the accompanying documentation.
   2. Updates will only be available for download and for use during the
      contract period.
   3. CodeAndWeb will provide free updates to the licensee for a period of 12
      months after downloading and activation of the license key (update
      period). After expiration of this period, the licensee will be obligated
      to pay for the use and for the provision of further updates. These costs
      will be determined by the specific license type and by the documented
      update fees, which will be displayed on CodeAndWeb's website.
   4. In case of a lifetime license, the update period shall cover the entire
      lifetime of the software.
   5. The licensee may make further use of the software versions, which have
      existed prior to expiration of the update period, but will not receive
      any further updates.
   6. Updates may require additional or deviating licensing terms, which should
      be accepted before starting or installing the program. Updates may
      replace previously licensed parts of the software, but do not increase
      the authorized number of clients or named users within the respective
      license type. The updates provided to the end-user are subject to the
      terms of this agreement. CodeAndWeb will make reasonable efforts to
      inform the end-user about any significant changes of the software.

**** 9. Warranty Rights ****

   1. CodeAndWeb points out that the current state of technology does not allow
      for creating software in a way that all applications and combinations, in
      particular with various hardware components and software frameworks, will
      work flawlessly at any time.
   2. Special conditions for end-users located in the European Union
         1. When you, being the client, are living in a country of the European
            Union or when your company is based in a country of the European
            Union when purchasing the software, the following warranty rights
            shall apply (warranty). In case of defects in the software or the
            associated documentation and upon notification by the end-user,
            CodeAndWeb will initially provide warranty by supplementary
            performance. For this, CodeAndWeb will, at the end-user's own
            choice, either provide him with a new, defect-free software version
            or will remove the defect.
         2. The assurance of a warranted feature or a guarantee shall always be
            in writing.
         3. If CodeAndWeb is not willing or not in a position to provide
            rectification or replacement or if the action will be delayed
            beyond the reasonable period agreed upon with the end-user or if
            the action will fail due to any other reasons, the end-user shall
            be entitled to withdraw from the contract or may insist on a
            reduction of the license price. A rectification or replacement
            shall only be considered as not having been carried out after
            CodeAndWeb has been given ample opportunity for rectification or
            replacement and when the actions did not produce the desired
            success, when rectification or replacement is not possible or
            refused or unreasonably delayed by CodeAndWeb, or when
            rectification has been carried out twice without success. The right
            of the end-user to claim for damages under § 437 of the German
            Civil Code (BGB) remains unaffected.
            The licensee shall take note of § 536 b and § 536 c of the German
            Civil Code (BGB). These shall not be applicable between the
            parties. The licensee has to inform and complain to CodeAndWeb
            about failures of TexturePacker immediately, but latest within 10
            working days.
            § 536 a II of the German Civil Code (BGB) (Selbstbeseitigungsrecht
            des Mieters) shall not be applicable. CodeAndWebs liability for
            failures regardless of fault § 536 a I of the German Civil Code
            (BGB) shall not be applicable.
         4. The end-user is responsible for determining the location where the
            software will be used and for determining the appropriate hardware
            environment.
         5. These warranty terms do not apply when the software is not used in
            compliance with this agreement or the documentation, when the
            software or parts of it have been modified by any entity other than
            CodeAndWeb or when a malfunctioning in the software has been caused
            by devices or software that have not been supplied by CodeAndWeb.
         6. The limitation period for all claims for damages is determined by
            legal provisions and begins with the delivery or providing/granting
            of the license.
         7. This warranty does not apply to software that has been provided to
            the end-user free of charge. CodeAndWeb, therefore, is not
            obligated to remove any defects or to pay compensation if the
            licensee uses a free TexturePacker evaluation license or the
            TexturePacker essential license.
         8. CodeAndWeb is not liable for any damages, which arise due to
            omitting the installation of updates. Apart from that, the
            following liability provisions shall apply analogously.
   3. Special conditions for end-users located in the US. When you, being the
      client, are living in the US or when your company is based there when
      purchasing the software, the following warranty rights shall apply
      (warranty).
         1. CodeAndWeb guarantees that the software licensed under this
            agreement will work substantially in compliance with the
            documentation for the period of sixty (60) days from the moment of
            the installation and activation with the license key ("warranty
            period"), including upgrades, which are provided within the
            warranty period for the rest of the warranty period.
         2. In case of a violation of the preceding limited warranty,
            CodeAndWeb undertakes to repair or replace the software or, if
            CodeAndWeb considers such a repair or replacement as commercially
            inappropriate, to refund the corresponding license fee.
         3. The preceding limited warranty does not apply when the software is
            not used in compliance with this agreement or the documentation,
            when the software or parts of it have been modified by any entity
            other than CodeAndWeb or when a malfunctioning in the software has
            been caused by devices or software which have not been supplied by
            CodeAndWeb.
         4. This warranty does not apply to software which has been provided to
            the end-user free of charge. CodeAndWeb, therefore, is not
            obligated to remove any defects or to pay compensation if the
            licensee uses a free TexturePacker evaluation license or the
            TexturePacker essential license.
         5. THE PRECEDING WARRANTIES ARE THE ONLY WARRANTIES APPLYING TO THE
            END-USER, INSOFAR AS HE IS LOCATED IN THE US AND THEY ARE IN LIEU
            OF ALL OTHER WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, IN
            PARTICULAR WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY,
            SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OF PROPERTY
            RIGHTS, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THE PROPERTY RIGHTS OF THIRD
            PARTIES.
         6. EXCEPT FOR THE LIMITED WARRANTY PREVIOUSLY SET OUT, THE SOFTWARE
            WILL BE SUPPLIED "AS IS". CodeAndWeb DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY WARRANTY
            OR GUARANTEE REGARDING ITS USE OR PERFORMANCE AND DOES NOT
            GUARANTEE, THAT THE OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE WILL BE FAIL-SAFE,
            FREE OF INTERRUPTIONS, ERRORS OR DEFECTS, OR THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL
            PROTECT FROM ANY POTENTIAL THREATS.

**** 10. Liability ****

   1. Special conditions for end-users located in the European Union:
      When you, being the client, are living in a country of the European Union
      or when your company is based there and you have purchased the software
      in such a country, the following liability provisions shall apply
      (liability).
         1. CodeAndWeb shall always be liable to the client
                # for damages caused deliberately or due to gross negligence by
                  CodeAndWeb or by legal representatives or performing agents
                  of CodeAndWeb as well as
                # under the German Product Liability Act and
                # for death, bodily injury or health damage, which lie in the
                  responsibility of CodeAndWeb, its legal representatives or
                  performing agents or
                # in case of the assurance of a guaranteed quality or a
                  warranted characteristic.
         2. CodeAndWeb, its legal representatives and performing agents shall
            not be liable in case of slight negligence. This does not apply
            insofar as there is a culpable violation of cardinal obligations or
            substantial contractual obligation. Cardinal obligations or
            substantial contractual obligations are obligations of CodeAndWeb,
            which must be fulfilled in the first place in order to enable the
            proper implementation of this contract and on the performance of
            which the client may regularly rely on, i.e. obligations, which may
            endanger the attainment of the purpose of the contract when
            violated.
         3. In case of losses of data CodeAndWeb shall not be liable to the
            extent described above. The provisions, which substantiate a
            mandatory liability of CodeAndWeb to the extent described above,
            remain unaffected.
         4. There is no further liability of CodeAndWeb. This shall also apply
            to lost profits and missed savings. Liability for other remote
            consequential damages is excluded.
         5. The limited liabilities above shall also apply to the personal
            liability of the employees, representatives and representative
            bodies of CodeAndWeb.
   2. Special conditions for end-users located in the US:
      When you, being the client, are living in the US or when your company is
      based there and you have purchased the software in such a country, the
      following liability provisions shall apply (liability).
         1. THE LIABILITY OF CodeAndWeb TOWARDS THE LICENSEE DUE TO ANY DAMAGES
            IS LIMITED TO DIRECT DAMAGES AND WILL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT THE
            LICENSEE ORIGINALLY HAS PAID FOR THE SOFTWARE.
         2. IN NO EVENT SHALL CodeAndWeb OR LEGAL REPRESENTATIVES OF CodeAndWeb
            BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, CONCRETE (PREDICTABLE)
            DAMAGES, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING BUT NOT
            LIMITED TO PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOST
            PROFIT, BENEFIT OR LOSS OF DATA; OR DUE TO BUSINESS INTERRUPTIONS),
            EVEN THOUGH CodeAndWeb OR THE REPRESENTATIVES OF CodeAndWeb HAVE
            BEEN INFORMED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

**** 11. Privacy ****

   1. Regarding the protection of personal data, the parties are obligated to
      observe the provisions of the Privacy Act and to commit their employees,
      who are connected with the contract and its execution, to comply with the
      regulations concerning data secrecy (obligation of confidentiality),
      unless they already have a general obligation to this.
   2. CodeAndWeb will collect and use client-related data only to the extent
      which is necessary to execute this contract (GDPR Art. 6, 1b). The
      following data is submitted with each start of TexturePacker: Installed
      version of TexturePacker, computer fingerprint, operating system and
      version, license type.
      Additional data submitted for single user, blogger or volume licenses:
      Account name of current user, computer name, license key.
      A previously activated license key is submitted when activating an
      upgrade license. The license server additionally stores data of a license
      activation and the date of the last use of TexturePacker.
      Trial activation data is automatically deleted after 180 days. Activation
      data of licenses is deleted 60 days after deactivating the license on a
      computer.
      Receiver of the data is CodeAndWeb and its hosting providers. See Privacy
      Policy for details.
   3. CodeAndWeb indicates that it does not have any influence on the data
      protection provisions and requirements of any invoicing companies. In
      this respect, the data protection provisions of the corresponding
      provider, which are applicable at the time of invoicing and payment,
      shall apply.
   4. While using the software, the end-user may use a reporting function or
      may submit a support request to CodeAndWeb. For providing support, the
      entry of an e-mail address is required in order to contact the end-user.
      For executing the support and for processing the reporting, CodeAndWeb
      uses a helpdesk provider. Please check Privacy_Policy for details of the
      currently used provider.
   5. The end-user agrees that concerning support requests and reporting
      functions the e-mail address of the end-user will be submitted to the
      helpdesk provider. In the event that the end-user does not desire such
      data processing, he may not use the support and reporting function in the
      software.
   6. Apart from that, the client always has the option of asking CodeAndWeb
      for stored data related to him, to change this data or to delete it.

**** 12. Applicable Law ****

   1. If the end-user has purchased the software in the European Union, German
      Law shall apply. In this case, the application of the UN Convention of
      Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will be excluded.
   2. If the end-user has purchased the software outside the European Union,
      the locally applicable law may apply. In this case, the respective
      substantive laws may apply for the interpretation of the contract.

**** 13. End-User's Contractual Right to Return Software ****

   1. The software will be offered to the end-user for download. Therefore, a
      right for withdrawal for the benefit of consumers does not exist. The
      right for withdrawal does not exist for contracts concerning the delivery
      of goods, which due to their nature are not suited for being returned.
      This includes the aforementioned software TexturePacker.
   2. Apart from this, however, CodeAndWeb grants the end-user a right to
      return the software within 30 days. If the end-user should notice within
      this period, that after the installation of the software and after the
      activation of the license key, the software or the selected license type
      does not suit his purposes, CodeAndWeb will refund the license fee.
      CodeAndWeb will then block the license key. The right to continue to use
      the free TexturePacker evaluation license or the TexturePacker essential
      license shall remain unaffected.

**** 14. Final Provisions ****

   1. The languages of this contract are German and English.
   2. The provided software (incl. accompanying material) is legally protected.
      The copyright, patent rights, trademark rights and all other ancillary
      copyrights in the software and in other objects, as well, which
      CodeAndWeb provides or makes accessible to the customer for the
      initiation and execution of a contract shall belong exclusively to
      CodeAndWeb.
   3. Agreements that deviate from these terms of use - including this clause -
      shall be in writing.
   4. For all disputes arising from or in connection with this contract,
      including the effectiveness of the contract, the sole competent court of
      jurisdiction shall be the Landgericht Ulm (District Court of Ulm), to the
      extent permitted by law. CodeAndWeb reserves the right to take legal
      action against the end-user at his place of business as well.
   5. The regulation of § 139 of the German Civil Code (BGB) shall be waived.
   6. If any provisions of this contract prove ineffective or unenforceable,
      the validity of the remaining provisions of this contract shall be
      unaffected. In this case, the invalid or ineffective provision must be
      replaced by a new regulation, which meets the intended purpose and shall
      apply from the beginning of the ineffectiveness.
   7. Insofar as provisions are concerned, which are essential or cannot be
      omitted without endangering the purpose of this contract, the contracting
      partners commit themselves, under consideration of the intended purpose,
      to interpret, to correct or to replace the contract with another
      effective and enforceable provision so that its commercial and legal
      purpose may be attained.
